## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Symlinks over hard links (cross-filesystem requirement)
- Configurable hot/cold at init (user may swap drives later)
- Bash only, no Python (host execution, minimize dependencies)
- Single modelstore CLI + individual cron scripts (interactive vs headless separation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Ollama manifest JSON schema field paths not fully specified in research — verify with `cat ~/.ollama/models/manifests/...` on actual DGX before writing ollama_adapter.sh
- Phase 3: DBUS session address injection for notify-send from cron is MEDIUM confidence on aarch64 — test on actual machine before committing approach
- Phase 4: Revert state file JSON schema not yet specified — design during Phase 4 planning before writing revert.sh
